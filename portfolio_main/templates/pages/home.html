    <p class="title">
        This is my portal to express my views, help others, and show off some of my projects. This site will include
        book reviews, ways I overcame challenges, and entrepreneurial thoughts and resources. I am currently a senior at
        Saint Maryâ€™s College of California majoring in honors finance. My two biggest passions are technology and
        economics. I spend the majority of my time programming and continuously reading and learning. Feel free to
        email, tweet or connect with me. I hope you enjoy your visit!

                    This has been one of the best decisions of my life. I spent the entire summer learning programming
                    during a 12 week bootcamp. I learned Javascript, Python, Django and got hooked really fast. In fact,
                    I now spend most of my time working on side projects while taking classes for my senior year.

                    I entered this competition after seeing my mom become a victim of price discrepancies in the healthcare system.
                    I came up with an idea in less than a week and put together a SWOT analysis. After making the finals
                    at the business competition, I found my idea too broad and pivoted to a system to cure access
                    capacity using dynamic pricing. This was the first major award I ever won. I learned an incredible
                    amount in a short time because of it.

                    After working two jobs for long enough, I decided it was time to finish my degree. I picked Saint
                    Mary's because I thought I could stand out, it was a liberal arts college that requires critical thinking, and I could build great
                    relationships with my professors. I love having deep discussions about finance, economics, and great literature in the
                    Seminar program. Saint Mary's is wonderful institution which allowed me to stay in the Bay Area.
